== Getting Started ==

Here's how easy it is to use…

1. Once you have the plugin installed, go to your Media library and add your web-calculator to it.
2. Go to 'Tools > Appizy' to see all available web-calculators in your WordPress.
3. Copy the shortcode associated to the file of your choice and paste it into the post or page of your choice.
4. Save the content and open it. The web-calculator is now embedded into your content.

== Installation ==

Appizy App Embed can be found and installed via the Plugin menu within WordPress administration (Plugins -> Add New).
 Alternatively, it can be downloaded from WordPress.org and installed manually.

1. Upload the entire `appizy-app-embed-code` folder to your `wp-content/plugins/` directory.

== Upgrade notice ==

The version 2.0.0 brings a brand new feature to your web-calculator: it is not now possible for any logged-in user to
save the current state of the web-calculator. All shortcodes previously added to your page or article are still working
but you need to update them to enable the "saving feature".
